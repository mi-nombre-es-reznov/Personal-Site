Known Issues:
- The opacities are overlapping in the CSS file between the main and the body tags. Because of this, there is an overlapping section that is a different color, despite both values
being exactly identical.

Possible Solution: Find the matching color of the opacity valued color and use that for both with 100% opacity, or no reduction in transparency.






Possible Improvements:
- make the image crest background transparent.
