                <!-- Section 1: Brief Introduction -->
                 <h2 class="headers">A Little About Me!</h2>
                 <p class="h-content">Hi, I'm Nicholas, the founder of NCompEng Technologies 
                    and a passionate computer engineer dedicated to creating meaningful 
                    solutions through innovation. With a background in Computer Engineering 
                    from the University of California, Riverside, my journey has been focused 
                    on leveraging technology to tackle real-world challenges. Whether it's 
                    through automating processes, streamlining workflows, or developing 
                    tools that drive efficiency, my goal is to push the boundaries of 
                    what's possible.</p>
                 <br><br>

                <!-- Section 2: Professional Summary -->
                 <h2 class="headers">My Professional Summary</h2>
                 <p class="h-content">Throughout my career, I've been dedicated to finding innovative 
                    solutions that combine technical expertise with a focus on efficiency and automation. 
                    Currently, in my work with State Reporting and Forms Development, I handle projects 
                    that help healthcare providers manage and submit essential data. My efforts also 
                    extend into developing automation systems that streamline workflows. One example is 
                    the Fresh Service automation I created to manage overdue tickets more efficiently. 
                    In addition, I'm working on projects like a first ticket response system designed to 
                    maintain SLA compliance and an automated pending review process that gives requesters 
                    multiple opportunities to review their completed requests before a timeout limit 
                    triggers ticket closure.<br><br>

                    At NCompEng Technologies, I offer a range of services, including second life resale 
                    through consignment, computer and device repair, paper printing, tax preparation, 
                    and handyman services. While I'm in the process of expanding into custom software 
                    development, I've already combined custom code and AI to build the very website where 
                    this content will be found.<br><br>
                    
                    Looking ahead, my primary focus is pushing automation forward, particularly through 
                    embedded systems and devices. Whether it's optimizing vehicular safety or designing 
                    automation for various industries, my goal is to create systems that save lives, 
                    enhance safety, and improve efficiency across multiple sectors. I'm excited about the 
                    role automation will play in shaping the future and committed to leading these changes 
                    through my work.</p>
